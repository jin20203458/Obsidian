[11969번: Breed Counting (acmicpc.net)](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/11969)
Farmer John's 𝑁\(N\) cows, conveniently numbered 1…𝑁\(1 \ldots N\), are all standing in a row (they seem to do so often that it now takes very little prompting from Farmer John to line them up). Each cow has a breed ID: 1 for Holsteins, 2 for Guernseys, and 3 for Jerseys. Farmer John would like your help counting the number of cows of each breed that lie within certain intervals of the ordering.
